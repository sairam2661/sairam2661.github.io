  We present Germinator, a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective fuzzing approach for extensible compilers like MLIR. By automatically extracting grammars from dialect specifications and using LLMs to generate diverse seed inputs, Germinator bootstraps coverage-guided fuzzing without manual effort. Evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, it improved line coverage by 10-120% and discovered 88 previously unknown bugs.
